# In BotScript we have not a "," for print more one argument because func PRINT() has only one.
# But we can print two argument on one line.
# This can be if we made from some argument one use a PLUS -> VAR x = "Hello, "; VAR y = "World!"; PRINT(x + y)
# The output: Hello, world!; 0

# Example

VAR name = INPUT()
PRINT("Hello, " + name)
